* MySQL Backup job example

Simple application to demonstrate how to run a job to backup MySQL

Start to deploy with ./deploy.sh (it would cleanup previous instance)

Start backuping with ./backup.sh

** Note :

- The backup script just output to the output, you can do whatever you like with
  it like putting it to a shared volume or object storage (i.e: s3, swift)

- The Job scheduling in kubernetes doesn't support currently scheduling so you
  have to resort to to the good ol cron to schedule those tasks to run the
  backup.sh

- The credentials are currently hardcoded for backup, I was using kube secrets to share
  those at first but this does not seems to work for the execNewPod/post
  container which I need to insert some data. I switched to template but that
  would not work for job as there is no start and stop job kind of thing (so if
  I create it in template it would automatically started at creation). Feeding
  this back to the devs
